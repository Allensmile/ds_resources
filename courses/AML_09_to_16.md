## Intro
- Gradient boosting, a method used with decision trees
- widely used method
- used to power a lot of decision making on internet, like FB timeline; now they generally use neural networks

## Boosting (in General)
- also an ensemble technique, but smarter than doing bagging 
- in boosting:  each model is very weak so averaging them will not do it; instead
