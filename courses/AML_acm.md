## Progress
1. Intro
2. Git, GitHub and Testing
3. Matplotlib and Visualization
4. Intro to Supervised Learning
5. Preprocessing



### Notes
- Parametric model example:  linear
  - assume underlying statistical distributions in the data.
- Non-parametric model example
  - do not rely on any distribution
  - decision tree
  - random forest
  - rank test

## Scaling
### `StandardScaler`
- also called "Z Score" which is ~N(0,1)
- makes sense for Gaussian data

### `MinMaxScaler`
- usually between (0, 1); can also do (-1, 1)
- more useful if you have fixed boundaries
