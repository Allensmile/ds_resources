I had often heard rumors of a mythical editor so powerful and some infinite in its capabilities that people were afraid to approach it. That editor’s name was Emacs. When I first started Emacs I had absolutely no knowledge of Lisp what-so-ever, so dealing with it’s configuration in the beginning was a bit hard – I often copied some bits and piece of code that I didn’t fully understand and when there was an error within some of those snippets, I was having a really hard time figuring it out. Luckily for me I found a copy of Learning Emacs – a nice (but not great) book that gently guided me through the maelstrom of Emacs features. At first I was hardly efficient in Emacs, but my proficiency in it quickly grew.
