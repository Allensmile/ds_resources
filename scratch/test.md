It is interesting to note that Python and R were released in the early 90's (1990 and 1993) and the women's communities were created nearly 20 years later.  Python did not add a woman to their core developer team until 2017, and it seems that R does not have a woman on its core development team.  This sheds some light on the need for creating, growing and supporting communities for women and all under-represented groups.
