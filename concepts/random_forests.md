# Random Forests

- can be used for both classification and regression problems
- Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
- uses sampling with replacement




basic idea of bootstrapping is that you use your sample as a population. And from it you sample repeatedly, with replacement, to build other samples of the same size as your original sample.
