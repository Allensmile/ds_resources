# Naive Bayes

## About
- based on the so-called Bayesian theorem
- is particularly suited when the dimensionality of the inputs is high
- despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can often outperform more sophisticated classification methods
 
## Assumptions

Assumes that the features of X are conditionally independent of each other's given Y. So, if the features are dependant on each other, the prediction might be poor.

Surprisingly naive bayes performs well even if the features are not independent (inter-correlation among predictor variables may not be as strong)
