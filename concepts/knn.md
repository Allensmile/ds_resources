# KNN 

## Distance Metrics

Some of the distance metrics used in KNN are 

## Euclidean distance (L2 distance)

## Manhattan distance (city-block aka L1 distance)

## Jaccard distance (1 - (size of intersection/size of union). applies to sets, like bag of words)

## Cosine distance (which is the degree between 2 vectors - better for text data because euclidean distance is sensitive to document length).

## Strings

### Hamming distance (for strings - #of positions where the characters are different for equal length strings)

### Levenshtein distance (string metric - min number of edits needed to change one string to another) for discrete variables like strings.
