# Linear Regression

## Assumptions
- errors are independent
- normal distribution of errors
- homoscedasticity

- relationship between dependent variable (y) and the explanatory variables are linear (itâ€™s linear because the features are combined in a linear fashion)
- the explanatory variables can be numerical or categorical
- the residual errors from regression fit are normally distributed
- Homoscedasticity: Variances of errors is same across all levels

## R^2 
- indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)
