### Entropy


### Ensemble Methods

### Bagging
**Bagging** means randomly extracting smaller datasets (we refer to them as bags of data) from the main training dataset and constructing a separate decision tree for each bag.

### Bootstrapping
- basic idea of bootstrapping is that you use your sample as a population. And from it you sample repeatedly, with replacement, to build other samples of the same size as your original sample.

### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

### Pareto Principle | 80/20 rule
Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rules, (the law of the vital few, and the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
