### Bagging
**Bagging** means randomly extracting smaller datasets (we refer to them as bags of data) from the main training dataset and constructing a separate decision tree for each bag.

### Bootstrapping
- basic idea of bootstrapping is that you use your sample as a population. And from it you sample repeatedly, with replacement, to build other samples of the same size as your original sample.
